## Development

### Quick Start Guide

1. **Start the server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Access the API**: http://localhost:3001
3. **Login with test accounts** (see Test Accounts section above)
4. **Test endpoints** using the browser preview or API client

### Frontend Development

The React frontend is located in the `client/` directory with the following structure:

```
client/
├── src/
│   ├── components/       # Reusable UI components
│   ├── pages/           # Page components
│   ├── contexts/        # React contexts for state management
│   └── App.js          # Main application component
├── public/             # Static assets
└── package.json        # Frontend dependencies
```

### Building for Production
```bash
# Build frontend
cd client && npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```
